Section 2 - Joshua Moore= Visualise Sensor Data(Matplotlib) 
Plots the data for sitting as a matplotlib inline
[input] Gathers the values from the 24 distinct data sets 
[output] Plots the values at three distinct lines on a graph in 2D (from 0-1000): 
0.9 (0x25dd3327bb0)
0.3 (0x25dd3327c70)
-0.2 (0x25dd3327d00)

The graph is showing the 3 data points for the Accelerometer Axis: A1, A2 & A3 from 500-1500. Due to the relatively flat line on the graph this shows that there is relatively no increase in acceleration in a person's wrist during the activity of sitting.  
Section 3- Baizid Bostami - Sensor Data signal Processing (Scipy)
For a research, there are a lot of constraints. Noise is one of them. Noise can be originated from different sources. But it can be reduced or removed by applying some filters
Scipy library is used for scientific computing.

The Graph:
The x-axix has values from (0-1000). The y-axis has values from  (-0.2 to 1.0)
The orange line has value of 0.9 at 0x11a5fa820
The green line has value of 0.3 at 0x11a5fa910
The blue line has a value of -0.2  at 0x11a5fa9d0

The difference between section 2 and section 3:
If we look at the data of section 2, we can see that there are a lot of noise. But in section 3, we have filtered the noise using the scipy library. Thatâ€™s why the sensor data is visually clear now.



Section 4 - Toby Laidlaw Feature Engineering
1.       The minimum value of the A1 wrist sensor in the segment 500-1500 for the activity sitting.
2.       The maximum value of the A1 wrist sensor in the segment 500-1500 for the activity sitting.
3.       The minimum value of the A2 wrist sensor in the segment 500-1500 for the activity sitting.
4.       The maximum value of the A2 wrist sensor in the segment 500-1500 for the activity sitting.
5.       The minimum value of the A3 wrist sensor in the segment 500-1500 for the activity sitting.
6.       The maximum value of the A3 wrist sensor in the segment 500-1500 for the activity sitting.
7.       The label sitting.
